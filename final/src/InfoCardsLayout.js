        It is likely that the NYPD spent at least twice as much to pay officers staying within sight of the stationary K5 than it did on leasing the robot itself. \n
        Of course, Adams’ boast about the low cost of leasing the robot wasn’t about this two-month trial. Instead, it was about the potential of eventually either replacing on-duty officers with robots like K5 or of expanding police presence in the city by adding K5s that aren’t always tailed by human officers. \n
        But how many K5 robots would need to be in the city to make them an effective, easily accessible way of reporting crimes and other incidents? To make them a first line of response worth the money paid for them? \n
        According to the official website of Times Square District Management Association, in 2019 the Times Square-42nd Street Subway station saw an average ridership of over 170,000 New Yorkers and visitors to the city passing through each day. The station officially serves as a stop for eight NYC Subway train lines–nine on weekends–-but it is also connected by winding passageways to the 42nd St. Port Authority station serving the A, C, and E lines.`}

        Though the spectacle of its unveiling might’ve suggested otherwise, the NYPD putting a single K5 into service was realistically never going to result in much more than a robot standing in place. The K5 cannot go up and down stairs, and Times Square-42nd Street is a sprawling multi-level station. Though both connected 42nd St stations are on the MTA’s list of ADA-accessible stations, routes through both that avoid stairs are winding. A K5, if left to navigate the entire station, would be a particularly slow monitoring tool. \n
        Anyone with more than a passing familiarity with the K5 before Adams’ announcement would already know this, and plenty of people are. First unveiled in 2014, Knightscope’s K5 robots have been deployed in numerous locales for years now. Criticism of the machines–and outright failures–are well-documented. \n
        K5s started making headlines soon after they were released. Perhaps predictably, the robots were not welcomed or even just tolerated in every place they were deployed.`}
